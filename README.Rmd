# ISC-proposal

![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/FAIReLABS/isc-proposal-panacea.svg?branch=master)

**Package name:** Portable ANalytical data Aggregation and Coordination for database Entry and Access (panacea)

This a proposal for the Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) of the R consortium. The proposed package panacea will make data streams in analytical laboratory settings more transparent and easily accessible. This is needed as closed sourced vendor-supplied software for analytical instruments often act as black boxes, thereby inhibiting access to raw data and full-disclosure of critical processing and transformations. Ultimately, panacea could help establish fully integrated laboratories with centralised data management.  Hence this solution contributes to the FAIR^[Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable] guiding principles for data, thereby stimulating innovation, and inclusiveness through open science.
