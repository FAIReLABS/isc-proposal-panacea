## Overview

The integrated lab (see Fig \@ref(fig:intlab)) is a solution to centralise data management of the traditional unconnected lab by collecting and harmonizing data streams from various lab instruments (software package 1), and by providing open-sourced alternatives for routine analytical workflows (software package 3). These routine analytics are now often locked away in a plethora of vendor supplied software suits. Because of our background in Earth sciences, this project ("the integrated lab") will, as an initial step, focus on observational data from (geo)chemical laboratory facilities. However, it is expected that the tool can eventually broadly employed in various laboratory settings and to accomodate for the demands of various scientific disciplines.

## Detail

Observational chemical data generated by commercial analytical instrumentation and accompanying software are either recorded as structured or unstructured text files. A Natural Language Processing (NLP)/Machine Learning (ML) based data and metadata collection and harmonising tool will be developed to cope with the read-out and formatting of unstructured data into a more convenient human and machine-readable format. Encoding of this solution in the C++ language ensures that the instrumental (meta)data output can be standardized for ingestion into a central data management system, such as the data ingest (i.e., data import) subsystem of iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System). PANACEA will also be cast into an stand-alone data extraction and accessing tool for the R environment. This is done with a *pointer to S expression* (SEXP) type wrapper function [@Eddelbuettel2011]. This approach of extending the R core interpreter with C++ ensures a lean and fast approach. Besides good data management, this tool also aids online monitoring of lab performance. With the integration of (meta)data from different sources, this could theoretically provide opportunities for early detection of problems, such as sample/reagent pollution and anomalous lab-environmental conditions. The latter problems would be much harder to detect with stand-alone vendor supplied solutions.
