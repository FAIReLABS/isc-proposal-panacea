## Overview

The integrated lab  is a solution to centralise data management of the traditional unconnected lab (see "Integrated Lab" Fig \@ref(fig:intlab)). A first step in the realisation of the integrated lab would encompass a solution for collecting and harmonizing data streams from various lab instruments. The development of the R package PANACEA will attempt to provide a more universal solution

make data streams in analytical laboratory settings more transparent and easily accessible.

## Detail

Observational chemical data generated by commercial analytical instrumentation and accompanying software are either recorded as structured or unstructured text files. A Natural Language Processing (NLP)/Machine Learning (ML) based data and metadata collection and harmonising tool will be developed to cope with the read-out and formatting of unstructured data into a more convenient human and machine-readable format. Encoding of this solution in the C++ language ensures that the instrumental (meta)data output can be standardized for ingestion into a central data management system, such as the data ingest (i.e., data import) subsystem of iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System). PANACEA will also be cast into an stand-alone data extraction and accessing tool for the R environment. This is done with a *pointer to S expression* (SEXP) type wrapper function [@Eddelbuettel2011]. This approach of extending the R core interpreter with C++ ensures a lean and fast approach. Besides good data management, this tool also aids online monitoring of lab performance. With the integration of (meta)data from different sources, this could theoretically provide opportunities for early detection of problems, such as sample/reagent pollution and anomalous lab-environmental conditions. The latter problems would be much harder to detect with stand-alone vendor supplied solutions.
