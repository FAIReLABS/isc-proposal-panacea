# The proposal
<!--
This is where the proposal should be outlined.

## Overview

The integrated lab (see Fig \@ref(fig:intlab)) is a solution to centralise data management of the traditional unconnected lab by collecting and harmonizing data streams from various lab instruments (software package 1), and by providing open-sourced alternatives for routine analytical workflows (software package 3). These routine analytics are now often locked away in a plethora of vendor supplied software suits. Because of our background in Earth sciences, this project ("the integrated lab") will, as an initial step, focus on observational data from (geo)chemical laboratory facilities.
